        <hr width="50%" size="2"><br />
        <p> Epilepsy remains a complex neurological condition, necessitating innovative approaches to understanding and mitigating seizure activity.
        This workshop is designed to bring together computational neuroscientists and researchers with experimental and clinical background to explore 
        cutting-edge strategies in epilepsy modeling and seizure control. For the general content structure, we plan to start from a modeler's perspective
        and then progressively move towards more data-driven approaches.<br /><br />
        The first session will explore seizure mechanisms through biophysical and neural mass models at different temporal and spatial scales, investigating, 
        among others, ionic dynamics and network plasticity. It aims to understand seizure initiation, progression, and duration.<br /><br />
        The second session will examine stimulation-based strategies to terminate or prevent seizures. There will be a focus on recent advancements in closed-loop
        and low-frequency electrical stimulation to control seizures. On top of model-based approaches, this session will also include the clinical perspective on
        stimulation treatment and data-driven studies.<br /><br />
        The third session will focus on the application of computational models to EEG data recorded in epileptic patients. First, it will discuss advanced parameter
        inference methods to tailor models to individual data samples to provide mechanistic insight. It then moves on to issues of seizure monitoring using wearable
        devices and long-term EEG recordings, and in particular the use of data features inspired by concepts derived from mathematical modeling in epilepsy.</p><br /><br />

                <b>Neuronal and Ionic Dynamics during Focal Seizures: Insights from Biophysical Modeling</b><br />
            </p>
            <div id="content1" class="hidden-content">
                <p class="centered-justified">Human and animal EEG data suggest that epileptic seizures are not stationary events, but
                rather evolve dynamically over tens of seconds. We explore the processes linked to seizure
                dynamics by enhancing the Hodgkin-Huxley mathematical model with the physical laws
                governing ion movement. This enhancement enables us to replicate in silico the
                electrographic pattern of a typical human focal seizure, which consists of distinct phases: the
                onset of low-voltage fast activity, the tonic phase, the clonic phase, and the postictal
                suppression phase. Our study provides new insights into potential mechanisms of seizure
                initiation by inhibitory interneurons through K+ accumulation, as well as seizure termination
                and the postictal state via upregulation of the outward Na+/K+ pump current. The model also
                clarifies ionic mechanisms that may underlie a key feature of seizure dynamics: the
                progressive slowing of ictal discharges. Model predictions regarding the specific scaling of
                inter-burst intervals are validated in both in vitro and human seizure data, suggesting these
                mechanisms may be preserved across different models and species.</p>

                <b>Expansion of epileptogenic networks via neuroplasticity in neural mass models</b><br />
            </p>
            <div id="content2" class="hidden-content">
                <p class="centered-justified">Neuroplasticity refers to functional and structural changes in brain regions in
                response to healthy and pathological activity. Activity dependent plasticity induced by
                epileptic activity can involve healthy brain regions into the epileptogenic network by
                perturbing their excitation/inhibition balance. In this article, we present a new neural mass
                model, which accounts for neuroplasticity, for investigating the possible mechanisms
                underlying the epileptogenic network expansion. Our multiple-timescale model is inspired
                by physiological calcium-mediated synaptic plasticity and pathological extrasynaptic N-
                methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) dependent plasticity dynamics. The model highlights that
                synaptic plasticity at excitatory connections and structural changes in the inhibitory system
                can transform a healthy region into a secondary epileptic focus under recurrent seizures and
                interictal activity occurring in the primary focus. Our results suggest that the latent period of
                this transformation can provide a window of opportunity to prevent the expansion of
                epileptogenic networks, formation of an epileptic focus, or other comorbidities associated
                with epileptic activity.</p><br />

                <b>How enhanced slow inactivation of Na+ channels may promote depolarization block in Dravet syndrome</b><br />
            </p>
            <div id="content3" class="hidden-content">
                <p class="centered-justified">Dravet syndrome is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) that typically
                begins in the first year of life. This complex pathology is characterized by drug-resistant
                seizures, various comorbidi1es such as cognitive delay, and a risk of early death. Most cases
                are due to mutations of NaV1.1, a voltage-gated sodium channel expressed in fast-spiking
                (FS) inhibitory neurons. The pathological mechanism in the initial stage of the disease
                involves impaired function of those neurons, leading to network hyperexcitability. However,
                the details remain unclear.<br />
                Mutations of NaV1.1 may result in non-functional channels or channels with altered gating
                properties. We focus on the less studied case of altered gating, by investigating how it
                impairs neuronal ac1vity in the case of a specific mutation (A1783V). Using recordings in cell
                lines, Layer et al. (2021) showed that A1783V alters the voltage dependence of channel
                activation, as well as the voltage dependence and kinetics of slow inactivation. Slow
                inactivation is a mechanism dis1nct from the fast inactivation of sodium channels at each
                spike, developing much more slowly, during prolonged trains of depolariza1on.
                Implementing the three effects of the mutation in a conductance-based model, Layer et al.
                predict that altered activation has the largest impact on channel function, as it causes the
                most severe reduction in firing rate.<br />
                Using conductance-based models tailored to the dynamics of FS inhibitory neurons, we
                examine how the three alterations affect susceptibility to depolariza1on block, another firing
                deficit aside from frequency reduction. We look deeper into slow inactivation, exploiting the
                timescale difference with the rest of the system. We find that slow inactivation of mutant
                channels at lower voltage values than wild type channels favors depolarization block upon
                sustained stimulation. More precisely, shifting the steady-state voltage dependence of slow
                inactivation destroys the stable limit cycle of the full system corresponding to tonic spiking,
                and creates a stable equilibrium corresponding to depolarization block. The accelerated
                kinetics of slow inactivation in mutant channels hastens the transition from tonic spiking to
                depolarization block. These findings suggest that alterations of NaV1.1 slow inactivation
                should not be neglected as they might play an important pathological role, adding to the
                conclusions of Layer et al. on the consequences of altered NaV1.1 activation.</p><br />

                <p class="centered-justified">Epileptic seizures are transient occurrences of abnormal, excessive, 
                    or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain, representing a core manifestation of epilepsy. 
                    Moreover, seizures are highly specific to the individual in terms of where they occur, 
                    what brain networks they involve and how they propagate through the brain. 
                    To further understand the individualised mechanisms of seizures we have developed a 
                    simulation-based inference technique based on long-short-term-memory neural networks and 
                    neural mass models to infer neurophysiological population-level variables from intracranial 
                    electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. Using long-term iEEG recordings from 15 patients and 
                    involving 2000+ seizures, the inference framework has been applied to reveal how stability and 
                    chaoticity of the brain networks during seizures varies across individuals and their seizures. 
                    While there were clear individual differences, many patients showed a consistent increase in 
                    stability based on the eigenspectrum just after seizure onset. On the other hand the chaoticity 
                    dynamics based on the Lyapunov spectrum were less consistent. The neurophysiological population-level 
                    variable estimates involved in this analysis were also employed to predict if a seizure will be short
                    or long just based on the estimates during the first few seconds of a seizure. Moreover, the estimates 
                    were used to predict the occurrence of seizures through a seizure forecasting analysis applied to the 
                    long term recordings. Results and implications for the field will be discussed.</p>

            <div id="content5" class="hidden-content">
                <p class="centered-justified">In the field of computational epilepsy, neural field models 
                    helped to understand some large-scale features of seizure dynamics. These insights 
                    however remain on general levels, without translation to the clinical settings via 
                    personalization of the model with the patient-specific structure. In particular, a 
                    link was suggested between epileptic seizures spreading across the cortical surface 
                    and the so-called theta-alpha activity (TAA) pattern seen on intracranial electrographic 
                    signals, yet this link was not demonstrated on a patient-specific level. I will present 
                    a single patient computational study linking the seizure spreading across the patient-specific 
                    cortical surface with a specific instance of the TAA pattern recorded in the patient. 
                    Using the realistic geometry of the cortical surface we performed the simulations of seizure 
                    dynamics in The Virtual Brain platform, and we show that the simulated electrographic signals 
                    qualitatively agree with the recorded signals. Furthermore, the comparison with the simulations 
                    performed on surrogate surfaces reveals that the best quantitative fit is obtained for the real 
                    surface. The work illustrates how the patient-specific cortical geometry can be utilized in The 
                    Virtual Brain for personalized model building, and the importance of such approach.</p>

            <div id="content6" class="hidden-content">
                <p class="centered-justified">The biological mechanisms underlying the spontaneous and recurrent transition to seizures in the epileptic brain are still poorly understood. 
                As a result, seizures remain uncontrolled in a substantial proportion of patients. 
                Brain stimulation is an emerging and promising method to treat various brain disorders, including drug-refractory epilepsy. 
                Selected stimulation protocols previously demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in reducing the seizure rate. 
                The stimulation efficacy critically depends on chosen stimulation parameters, such as the time point, amplitude, and frequency of stimulation. 
                This study aims to explore the neurobiological impact of 1Hz stimulation and provide the mechanistic explanation behind its seizure-delaying and seizure-suppressing effects. 
                We study this effect using a computational model, a modified version of the Epileptor-2 model, in close comparison with such stimulation effects on spontaneous seizures recorded \textit{in vitro} in a high-potassium model of ictogenesis in rat hippocampal slices.  
                In particular, we investigate the mechanisms and dynamics of spontaneous seizure emergence, the seizure-delaying effect of the stimulation, and the optimal stimulation parameters to achieve the maximal anti-seizure effect. 
                We show that the modified Epileptor-2 model replicates key experimental observations, and captures seizure dynamics and the anti-seizure effects of low-frequency electrical stimulation (LFES) observed in hippocampal slices. 
                We identify the critical thresholds in the model for seizure onset and determine the optimal stimulation parameters -- timing, amplitude, and duration -- that exceed specific thresholds to delay seizures without triggering premature seizures. 
                Our study highlights the central role of sodium-potassium pump dynamics in terminating seizures and mediating the LFES effect.</p>

                    Electrical stimulation is an increasingly popular method to terminate epileptic 
                    seizures; yet it is not always successful. One of the potential reasons for inconsistent 
                    efficacy is that stimuli are applied empirically, without considering the underlying dynamical 
                    properties of a given seizure.  In this work, we find that different seizure types have vastly 
                    different responses to controlling stimuli. We use the Taxonomy of Seizure Dynamics to model different
                    onset dynamotypes, then determine the ability of ictal stimulation to abort seizures after they have started. 
                    Within the model, the aborting input is realized as an applied stimulus trying to force the system from a bursting 
                    state to a quiescent or resting state. This transition requires bistability, which is not present in all onset 
                    dynamotypes. We examine how topological and geometric differences in bistable phase spaces affect the
                    probability of termination as the burster progresses from onset to offset. We find that the most significant 
                    determining factors are (1) the presence or absence of a baseline (DC) shift and (2) the dynamotype 
                    (onset/offset bifurcations) of the burster. Generally, we find that bursters that have a DC shift are 
                    far more likely to be terminated than those without because they are not as sensitive to the phase at 
                    which stimulation occurs. Furthermore, we observe that the probability of termination varies throughout 
                    the burster’s duration and is highly correlated to its dynamotype.  Our model provides a method to predict 
                    the optimal method of termination for each dynamotype.  We conclude that strategies for aborting seizures 
                    with ictal stimulation must account for seizure dynamotype to optimize efficacy. </p><br />

            <div id="content8" class="hidden-content">
                <p class="centered-justified"> Optogenetic inhibition of excitatory neuronal populations has emerged as a promising strategy for
                treating refractory epilepsy. However, achieving consistent seizure suppression in animal models using optogenetics has proven difficult. 
                These challenges are largely due to suboptimal stimulation protocols, which involve numerous complex and interacting variables.
                </p><br />
                <p class="centered-justified"> To better understand the impact of these parameters, a mathematical model was developed by fitting data 
                from the chloride-conducting opsin GtACR2 and integrating it with a conductance-based model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron. This framework 
                was further extended to include potassium-conducting opsins, allowing for comparative analysis of different inhibitory mechanisms. 
                Simulations using this model show that the effectiveness of optogenetic modulation is highly dependent on stimulation parameters, 
                the neuronal environment, and the opsin ion type.
                </p><br />
                <p class="centered-justified"> Additionally, a simplified opsin model was introduced to facilitate the incorporation of experimentally 
                derived parameters describing opsin dynamics. This model enables systematic studies of opsin properties, revealing that variations in 
                kinetics have minimal effect on the overall outcome of optogenetic inhibition, provided that the factor of change to opening and closing 
                time constants remains between 0.5 to 2. Moreover, the previously determined impact of the stimulation paradigm is largely unaffected by 
                changes in opsin characteristics.
                </p><br />
                <p class="centered-justified"> In summary, computational modeling of optogenetic inhibition in CA1 pyramidal neurons provides valuable 
                insights into how stimulation settings, opsin properties, and neuronal physiology interact. The proposed simplified opsin model offers 
                a data-efficient and accessible tool to support future research aimed at optimizing optogenetic strategies for seizure suppression.</p>

                    Objective: Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) for epilepsy applies therapeutic stimulation
                    in response to detected epileptic activity using intracranial electrodes. Prior studies have
                    found that people with successful seizure reduction using RNS devices undergo functional
                    network changes [1]. We hypothesise that the timing of stimulation, specifically stimulation
                    during non-epileptic brain states, is critical in driving long-term changes to restore healthy
                    brain networks. </p><br />
                <p class="centered-justified">
                    Methods: Simulation episodes occurring in low-risk epochs was characterized in a cohort of
                    40 people with epilepsy treated with the RNS System at the University of Utah, USA. People
                    were categorized into three groups based on their seizure reduction values: super
                    responders (>90% reduction, n=10), intermediate responders (≥ 50% reduction and ≤ 90%
                    reduction), n=19, and poor responders (<50% reduction, n=11). Low-risk periods were
                    defined as days which had fewer long epileptic episode counts than the weekly average from
                    the prior week.</p><br />
                <p class="centered-justified">
                    Results: Super-responders spent more time in and experienced more frequent stimulation
                    during low-risk periods (Pearson’s correlation: p=1.88e-3 and p=1.59e-3). Additionally,
                    circadian rhythmicity was an indicator of improved seizure reduction (Pearson’s correlation:
                    p=0.045 and 1.55e-3), and stimulation of super-responders was less phase- locked to long
                    epileptic episodes (two-sample Kuiper test; p<0.01). Baseline seizure frequency, epilepsy
                    duration, and age was not a statistical predictor of outcome. </p><br />
                <p class="centered-justified">
                    Conclusions: Individuals with greater seizure reduction experienced more stimulation
                    episodes during low-risk periods and spent more time in low-risk periods from stimulation
                    onset. Targeting low-risk brain states may improve seizure reduction though
                    neuromodulation via network restructuring driven by neuromodulation-induced plasticity. </p><br />

                a powerful framework for interpreting EEG data by inferring the physiological mechanisms underlying the observed signals. 
                Here, we will discuss key technical challenges involved in performing model calibration and parameter inference on EEG
