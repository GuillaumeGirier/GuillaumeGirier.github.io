    <p><FONT size="15pt"><b> PROJECT DESCRIPTION : </b> The main thread of this project is the study of the mathematical concept of integrator and resonator neuron through biophysical models (INa/IK type) and phenomenological models, 
	as well as the possibility that the behavior of a neuron model changes from resonator integrator under the effect of an external forcing, although the two behaviors are significantly different. Described in the book Dynamical 
	System in Neuroscience by Eugene M. Izhikevich, as well as in several other experimental articles on the subject, the characteristics of these two types of neurons are clearly established: the so-called "integrator" neuron has 
	an excitability threshold which defines whether the neuron is in activity or not, belongs to class I of excitability (which means that its frequency tends towards 0 during the transition between the stationary and periodic regime), 
	and does not have an subthreshold oscillation. The so-called "resonator" neuron does not have a precise threshold of excitability, belongs to class II of excitability (which means that its frequency does not tend towards 0 during 
	the transition between the stationary and periodic regime), and has subthreshold oscillations.</FONT></p>
    <p><FONT size="15pt">Based on the studies that have already been carried out on the mathematical analysis of integrator and resonator neurons and on the slow-fast dynamics of systems of differential equations, the aim is therefore to 
	seek to show that an integrator neuron can have the behavior of a resonator neuron, and therefore have oscillations below the precise threshold which normally defines it. Thus, on a non-forced model of integrating neuron, a slow 
	forcing will be imposed in order to reveal a pseudo-collar point and, for well-established parameters, small oscillations of trajectories near it: the model forced will therefore have the behavior of a resonator. </FONT></p>

    <p><FONT size="15pt"><b> PROJECT DESCRIPTION : </b> Due to their plasticity, synapses have the ability to adapt their efficiency to transmit electrical current, and this on different time scales. In the short term, this plasticity 
	is transient and is broken down into several phenomena that will raise the cognitive capacity linked to a temporary maintenance and manipulation of the information maintained in the activity within the pyramidal cells of the neocortex: the memory of job.</FONT></p>

    <p><FONT size="15pt"><b> PROJECT DESCRIPTION : </b> Malaria is the most deadly parasitic disease in the world, with an average of 445 000 deaths each year, and is caused by Plasmodium. In a joint European project against this disease, 
	the team 12 of the “Centre d’Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses'' is working on the identification and pre-clinical validation of a new therapeutic target, focusing on the hepatic stage of the life cycle of Plasmodium. 
	For a good study of parasites, a protocol project for sorting infected cells is set up. In this context, P. berghei is used, and “humanized” mice at liver level will be infected by this parasite. First, we studied mouse liver 
	infections by immunostaining on frozen liver slides. Assays of human albumin were performed for the study of the humanization of these humanized mice. A comparative study of the cytometers, thanks to immunostaining, made it 
	possible to define that the Astrios system is the most effective in the sorting of the liver cells.</FONT></p>
